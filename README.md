❤️ Why TreeGen?
TreeGen-Terminal was born from a real-world productivity need.
It evolved into an essential daily tool for quickly visualizing file structures, creating clean documentation, and maintaining clarity in development environments.

This project is a tribute to:

Simplicity

Efficiency

Collaboration

It brings the spirit of old-school terminal usage back to life, enhanced for modern creativity and flexibility.

"Not just another script — a timeless tool for timeless minds."

🛠️ Final Considerations
TreeGen-Terminal is designed to be minimal, intuitive, and powerful.

It adapts to your terminal: if Emojis are not supported, it gracefully falls back to ASCII automatically.

No external dependencies. No frameworks. Just pure Bash.

If you love clean terminal tools and efficient workflows, TreeGen-Terminal will become one of your daily essentials.
